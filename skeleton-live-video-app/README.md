Fritz is the machine learning platform for iOS and Android developers. In order to run computer vision models or tasks, you have to dive into the Camera 2 API. In order to make it easier for developers to try out ML models, we've created a simple camera app to get started.

For a full list tutorials, please visit our [examples and tutorials page](https://www.fritz.ai/resources/tutorials.html).

## Requirements
- Android Studio 3.2 or above
- Android device in developer model (USB debugging enabled)

## Getting Started

**Step 1: Create a Fritz Account**

In order to use Fritz, please [register for a free account](https://app.fritz.ai/register).

**Step 2: Clone / Fork the fritz-android-tutorials repository and open the camera app in Android Stuido**

```
git clone https://github.com/fritzlabs/fritz-android-tutorials.git
```

In Android Studio, choose "Open an existing Android Studio project" and select ``skeleton-live-video-app``.

**Step 3: Build the Android Studio Project**

Select "Build > Make Project" from the top nav. Download any missing libraries if applicable. This should sync the gradle dependencies so give the build a second to complete.

**Step 4: Install the app onto your device**

With your Android device connected, select ``Run > Run App`` from the top nav. You should see a simple camera app for you to play around with.

In future tutorials, we'll use this as a starting point in order to run the model on each camera frame and show the result.
